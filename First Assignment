<h1>Casey Walters</h1>
<p>I am a senior here at NIU studying Marketing and OMIS. I live in St. Charles IL, and I am part of Delta Sigma Pi; one of the co-ed business fraternities on campus. I am also part of OMIS SAB. For fun I like to read, paint, and bake. I have a cat named Kato who doesn't like me much. I cheer for the Chicago Cubs and I watch 'The Office' on Netflix an unhealthy amount.  </p>
